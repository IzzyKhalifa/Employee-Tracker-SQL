# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## The Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. This project is a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application won’t be deployed, there is a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and how to use it. 

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Mock-Up

The following video shows an example of the application being used from the command line:
